CS 457/557 FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
ASSIGNMENT 4

Welcome to our fourth (and last) assignment! This assignment expands on our previous assignment to explore more uses of higher-order functions for processing collections of data in a functional way.

This assignment requires an installation of GHC and Cabal to complete. Refer to the lecture notes and recordings if you still need to install these tools.

As mentioned in lecture, you may find it helpful to use the Debug.Trace module to aid your debugging process. If you add an import for Debug.Trace, please make sure to remove the import and any trace calls before submitting your code, to avoid confusing the grading scripts.

To start the assignment, open src/TicTacToe.hs and start reading from the top. Read all the comments carefully and ask if anything is unclear!

The cheat sheet of terminal commands and REPL commands from assignment 2 are still relevant in this assignment, so review the assignment 2 README for instructions on how to build, interact with, and test the code in this project.

The "main" function in app/Main.hs has the same behavior as in assignment 2, where you can play tic-tac-toe interactively against an AI that will never lose if all of your functions are implemented correctly.

When you're finished with the assignment, submit ONLY your modified TicTacToe.hs file to the Canvas assignment 4 dropbox. PLEASE DO NOT ZIP OR RENAME YOUR FILE.
